# Signal-Generator
Signal Generator is a program that allows to generate various types of signals (DC / Ramp / General order polynomial / Exponential / Sinusoidal signals). This program allows the user to generate a signal of different types concatenated using breakpoints specified by the user. The user should also provide the time range, sampling frequency and the parameters of each signal to be generated such as: amplitude, slope, intercept, power, exponent, frequency, phase. After generating the signal, the user can perform some operations on it such as: amplitude scaling, time shift, expansion and compression.
